### Journal Questions:

- **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

For the DrivePass project, the client was a prep academy for students getting ready to test for their drivers license. They were looking to build a web application that would host their learning platform for students to view courses and study material. This system is comparable to D2L or Brightspace.

- **What did you do particularly well?**

Throughout the course I feel that I have learned to deliver concise, and clear to read diagrams that correctly portray the operation of the project.

- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise my early iterations of the business requirement document. In the early stages I did not fully understand the purpose or importance of the document.

- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

It is important to consider the users needs during the design process because it is ultimately _their_ site, and their needs should come before my opinions unless it is an impossible request or out of scope.

- **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I just approach design by thinking what needs to do something in order to achieve a certain function. For example, what needs to validate the user credentials? The server should validate user credentials.

For future designs, I would probably build a diagram for every process of the system to get a complete picture of exactly how everything should communicate.
